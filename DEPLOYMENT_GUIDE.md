# üöÄ Academic System - Production Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment to Vercel (Recommended)

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Create these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIGHLIGHT_PROJECT_ID=your_highlight_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_HIGHLIGHT_BACKEND_URL=https://pub.highlight.io
```

### 3. Deploy Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/academic-system

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or use GitHub integration (recommended)
# 1. Push to GitHub
# 2. Connect repository in Vercel dashboard
# 3. Auto-deploy on commits
```

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Netlify
```bash
# Build command
npm run build

# Publish directory
.next

# Environment variables: Same as Vercel
```

### Railway
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway deploy
```

### Self-Hosted (PM2)
```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

## Production Optimization

### Performance
```bash
# Enable compression in next.config.mjs
const nextConfig = {
  compress: true,
  poweredByHeader: false,
  generateEtags: false,
}
```

### Security Headers
```bash
# Add to next.config.mjs
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
    value: 'on'
  },

    value: 'DENY'
  }
]
```

## üéØ Go-Live Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Internal testing with limited users
- Performance monitoring
- Bug fixes and optimizations

### Phase 2: Beta Release (Week 2)
- Deploy to production
- Limited user access (selected departments)
- User feedback collection
- Feature refinements

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 3)
- All users onboarded
- Full feature availability
- Support documentation
- Training sessions

## üìû Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring Dashboards
- **Highlight.io**: Error tracking and session replay
- **Vercel Analytics**: Performance and usage metrics
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Database and API monitoring

### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Daily automated backups via Supabase
- **Code**: Version controlled in Git repository
- **Assets**: Stored in Supabase Storage with redundancy

### Update Process
1. Test changes in development
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Run automated tests
4. Deploy to production during low-usage hours
5. Monitor for issues post-deployment
