**DEPLOYMENT ORDER (CRITICAL!):**
===============================

🥇 **FIRST**: Deploy Role Settings

🥈 **SECOND**: Deploy QR Attendance System  
📁 File: database/qr-attendance-complete-setup.sql
🎯 Purpose: QR attendance system with role-based security

**VERIFICATION:**
================
After both deployments, run this query to verify:

```sql
SELECT 
  'profiles' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as count 
FROM profiles
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'attendance_sessions', 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM attendance_sessions
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'student_permissions', 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM student_permissions;
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
===================
- Wait for each script to complete before running the next
- Look for "Success" message after each execution
- Both scripts are now error-free and ready to deploy
- The system will be fully functional after both deployments
