## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the Academic System database to production with enhanced security, performance, and reliability features.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Supabase project created and configured
- [ ] Environment variables documented and secure
- [ ] Database backup strategy in place
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### 2. Security Requirements
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies reviewed
- [ ] API keys rotation schedule established
- [ ] Access control policies documented
- [ ] Security audit completed

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Database indexes reviewed and optimized
- [ ] Query performance baseline established
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented

## üîß Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# Run automated deployment
./deploy-database.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Backup Current Database**
   ```bash
   supabase db dump --db-url $SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

2. **Execute SQL Script**
   ```bash
   # Copy and paste the content of minimal-profiles-timetables-setup.sql
   # into Supabase SQL Editor and execute
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   ```sql
   -- Run verification queries in SQL Editor
   SELECT COUNT(*) as realtime_tables 
   FROM pg_publication_tables 
   WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
   ```

## üìä Deployment Features

### üîí Enhanced Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Comprehensive policies for all tables
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permissions for students, faculty, and admins
- **Data Validation**: Input constraints and type checking
- **Audit Trail**: Automated logging of critical operations

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **Strategic Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Composite Indexes**: For complex multi-column queries
- **Partial Indexes**: For filtered queries (e.g., unread notifications)
- **Connection Pooling**: Ready for high-concurrency scenarios

### üîÑ Realtime Capabilities
- **Live Data Sync**: Profiles, timetables, and notifications
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant updates across all clients
- **Presence Indicators**: User online/offline status
- **Collaborative Features**: Live editing and updates

### üßπ Automated Maintenance
- **Expired Data Cleanup**: Automatic removal of old notifications
- **Timestamp Updates**: Automated `updated_at` field management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and logging
- **Health Checks**: Regular system validation

## üåç Environment Configuration

### Development
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_local_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_local_service_key
```

### Staging
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://staging-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_staging_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_staging_service_key
```

### Production
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_prod_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_prod_service_key
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functional Testing
```bash
# Test database connectivity
curl -X POST 'https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/profiles' \
  -H 'apikey: your_anon_key' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### 2. Security Testing
- [ ] Test RLS policies with different user roles
- [ ] Verify unauthorized access is blocked
- [ ] Check API key restrictions
- [ ] Validate input sanitization

### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Run load tests on critical endpoints
- [ ] Monitor query execution times
- [ ] Check index usage statistics
- [ ] Verify connection pool efficiency

### 4. Realtime Testing
- [ ] Test live data synchronization
- [ ] Verify notification delivery
- [ ] Check connection stability
- [ ] Monitor subscription performance

## üìà Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Database Performance**: Query times, connection count, CPU usage
- **Realtime Activity**: Active subscriptions, message throughput
- **Security Events**: Failed authentication attempts, policy violations
- **Data Growth**: Table sizes, notification volume, cleanup effectiveness

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review performance metrics and slow queries
- **Monthly**: Analyze data growth and cleanup efficiency
- **Quarterly**: Security audit and policy review
- **Annually**: Full system architecture review

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Realtime Not Working
```sql
-- Check if tables are added to realtime
SELECT tablename FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';

-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'timetables', 'notifications');
```

#### 2. Permission Denied Errors
```sql
-- Check user permissions
SELECT grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_name IN ('profiles', 'timetables', 'notifications');
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Rollback Process
1. Stop application traffic
2. Restore from backup
3. Verify data integrity
4. Resume traffic gradually

#### Data Recovery
1. Identify affected timeframe
2. Check backup availability
3. Perform point-in-time recovery
4. Validate recovered data
